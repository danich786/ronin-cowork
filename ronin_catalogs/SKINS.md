# SKINS — the look, as entries you can replace

> A skin is a set of **design tokens**, and nothing else. It cannot add a rule, move a
> control or restyle one surface differently from another — it can only answer the
> questions `public/style.css` already asks under `@layer foundations`. That is the whole
> safety story: there is no selector here to get wrong.
>
> **This is a shadowable catalog** (`docs/architecture/shadowing.md`). The entries below ship and are
> replaced wholesale by an upgrade. Your own copy lives in the catalogs store, outside
> every repo — an upgrade cannot touch it and an uninstall leaves it. A `## name` of yours
> REPLACES the shipped one of that name whole; a new name is added after them;
> `- **hidden:** yes` removes one. Change nothing and you track the shipped skins forever;
> change one and that one is yours.
>
> **Format.** `- **label:**` and `- **blurb:**` are what a person reads. Every other line
> names a token from `@layer foundations`, in one of three spellings:
>
> | spelling | applies |
> |---|---|
> | `- **--radius-large:** 0` | **both shells** — shape, space, type and motion want this |
> | `- **dark--bg:** #05070a` | the dark shell only |
> | `- **light--bg:** #fffdf8` | the light shell only |
>
> **A token we rename keeps working here.** A skin naming an old name (`--muted-3`, `--setup-mark`,
> `--gc-cta-bg`, `--gc-cta-ink`, `--gc-cta-bg-hover`, `--kanban-*`, `--kiiro`, `--kaki-hint`, `--scope-*`,
> `--team-workbench-head-*`, `--cowork-head-*`, `--muted-2`, `--dim`, and the old rulers `--text-1`…`--text-10`,
> `--text-micro`, `--space-1`…`--space-12`, `--radius-xs/sm/md/lg/xl`, `--weight-medium`, `--leading-loose`) paints
> the token that replaced it; spell the new name and it wins. A `--cowork-head-*` name paints that part of all three
> header scopes; an old ruler rung paints the roles it mostly served (`public/js/skins.js` lists them). The roles
> themselves, and which one is for what, are in `docs/architecture/ui.md`.
>
> **Light and dark are an axis INSIDE a skin, not a thing a skin fights.** A shape skin
> names the bare form and is done — a corner is the same corner in either shell. A COLOUR
> skin gives both faces, so the flip keeps working: it is still the theme's job to say which
> shell you are in, and the skin's job to say what that shell looks like. (Before
> quietly spent the flip. If you name a colour bare, that is still what happens — legal, and
> occasionally the point.)
>
> **`stock` NAMES NOTHING BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY SPELLED — in `public/style.css`.** The two
> `:root` blocks under `@layer foundations` ARE Stock's two faces: `:root` is its dark face,
> `:root[data-theme='light']` its light face, mapping one-for-one onto the three spellings
> above. There is one mechanism here, not two. Stock lives in CSS rather than in this file
> for two reasons, and both are load-bearing:
>
> 1. **It is the FLOOR, and a floor that has to be fetched is not one.** On a first-ever
>    visit, with cleared storage, or with the tailnet flaky, the page paints correctly today
>    with no JS having run at all. Move the shipped palette here and there is nothing to
>    fall back to — not a flash of dark, a flash of *nothing*, with every `var(--bg)`
>    resolving to empty. Same law as stock ⊕ user in `docs/architecture/shadowing.md`: the stock layer
>    exists to be there before anything else is.
> 2. **Keeping a floor AND a copy here would be the same palette spelled twice** — the exact
>    drift the token rule exists to end — and `scripts/check-css.mjs` would measure the
>    wrong one. Its contrast floor reads token values out of the STYLESHEET, by selector,
>    from `@layer foundations` only; it has never heard of this file. So the CSS copy would
>    stay green while the copy that actually renders went unmeasured.
>
> Which is the honest limit of this whole feature: **a skin's colours are checked by
> nothing.** The shipped ones are hand-picked to stay clear of the floor; yours are yours.
