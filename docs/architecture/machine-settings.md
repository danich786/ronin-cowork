# Machine configuration

Ronin keeps machine configuration in one document:

```text
$(bin/ronin-store config)/machine_settings.json
```

The document contains the machine, owner, session, agent, setup, and Campaign choices.
Campaigns are keyed by their stable id inside `campaigns`. Authentication secrets and
passkeys are never returned by the configuration API.

When the machine document is absent, the first read imports `ronin.json` and the JSON
records in the Campaign store, writes the combined machine document atomically, and uses
that record from then on. Authentication and passkey records move to the credential store
during the same import.

`src/machine-settings.ts` owns normalization and the public record. It exports the only
two configuration operations:

```ts
readMachineSettings()
writeMachineSettings(family, value)
```

The read returns `{ set, observed, status, needed, schema }`. Only `set` is durable. The
durable document is read once and the in-process copy is replaced after an atomic write.
Machine observations are shared for five seconds; derived status and unmet needs use that
recent observation without repeating host probes inside collection reads.

The HTTP surface has one route and one verb in each direction:

```text
GET   /api/machine-settings
PATCH /api/machine-settings   { "family": "machine", "value": { "monitor": true } }
```

PATCH accepts a named family and its typed value. Unknown keys do not replace the
document. The browser uses `public/js/machine-settings.js`; the setup and standing views
interpret the schema through `public/js/machine-settings-schema.js`; the schema names no
routes.

Agents use `machine-settings`. Its composed read joins this secret-free record with the
selected Campaign, installation catalog, observed installed state, provider catalog, and
Workspace Folder detail. It keeps catalogued, observed, Campaign-on, and new-Team-default
states separate. When `--campaign` is omitted it resolves `RONIN_SESSION` by exact name and
uses that session's Campaign; it never substitutes the initial Campaign.

Writes go through the existing named routes: typed Machine Settings families,
`PUT /api/campaigns/:id`, and the named Workspace Folder routes. The command does not use
the legacy `campaigns` or `record-section` Machine Settings families and exposes no generic
document patch or store write. Observed, status, needed, schema, provider measurements, and
repository facts remain read-only.

Available session models come dynamically from the canonical Campaign/provider model
catalog used by the UI dropdowns. Neither this page nor the capability document carries a
model list. `session_create --help` renders current provider/model choices and defaults from
that shared source, so installation and configuration changes require no doc or code-list
maintenance.

Runtime environment variables override server values for the running process. They are
not written into the document.

## Families

A family names the server writer for one kind of configuration value. Each registry row's
`lands.family` is the only declaration of where that setting is written; the writer map in
`src/machine-settings.ts` is the server side of that contract. A registry coverage test
keeps every declared family, including generated provider-model fields, paired with a writer.

## Stock and store resources

`src/resources.ts` resolves shipped resources and the matching user store. A user file at
the same relative path replaces the shipped file whole; new user files join the result.
Every resolved item carries `origin` and `shadowed` state. Catalog sections, definitions,
Behaviors, ways, skins, lexicons, templates, session readings, and bundles use this resolution
rule. Directory listings and file contents are shared by resolver calls within one HTTP
request and are read again for the next request.
